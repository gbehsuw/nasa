                <h2>What is SMAP?</h2>
                <p>
                    SMAP is an orbiting observatory launched by NASA that measures the amount of water in soil across the Earth. Using this data, we can track floods and droughts in certain parts of the world. Since British Columbia is susceptible to forest fires due to droughts, we can use SMAP to confirm this.

            <div class="lessonCard">
                <h2>Why are we using it?</h2>
                <p>
                    By using the information provided by SMAP, we can analyze British Columbia’s dry soil moisture patterns throughout history, confirming that BC’s soil is drying out over time. With this information, we would know that droughts in BC are caused by climate change, and by using sustainable energies, we can decrease the rate of climate and dangerous occurrences, like wildfires.

                <p>
                    <span>On</span> March 31st 2015, Prince George, British Columbia the root zone soil moisture using a grid system of 9 km EASE-Grid 2.0  measured 0.389 - 0.391 m³/m³ (figure 1.a). Whereas on September 18th, 2024 the same region of Prince George, British Columbia displayed a decline in root zone soil moisture to 0.223 - 0.226 m³/m³.
<br>
<span>The</span> decline in root zone soil moisture suggests that the top 100 cm or 1 m of soil is retaining much less water content when compared to 2015. This directly impacts vegetation as lower moisture causes them to get drier. Subsequently, the vegetation becomes more susceptible to catching fire, thereby becoming a greater fuel source for wildfires. 
<br>
<span>There</span> are many factors that decrease soil moisture, but it is important to highlight that droughts where there are extended periods of below-average precipitation and overall climate change are significant leaders to reducing soil moisture. As plants and soil lose water faster than it can be replenished if precipitation is low and artificial climate change persists, it will undoubtedly pay negative effects on plant life and overall ecosystems.

                    Ultimately, it is important to acknowledge that the effects of climate change are prevalent in Canadian communities across the country. British Columbia in specific is witnessing large scale wildfires that are attributed to low soil moistures. Consequently, as the future leaders of Canada, it is essential for highschool students to access the various affordable tools that avoid using traditional energy sources. To follow the sustainable development goals: SDG 7 while integrating it into highschool learning there is a listed activity that is an affordable and easy to access approach of how to contribute in combating climate change.
